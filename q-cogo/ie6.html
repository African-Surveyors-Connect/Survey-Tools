<h2 style="background-color: #333333; margin-bottom: 1.2em;">MS Internet Explorer 6 or Earlier Detected!</h2>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<div class="highlight"> 

<p class="doc"><span class="b">Q-Cogo currently does not support early versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer. To use Q-Cogo, you MUST upgrade to a newer version browser.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="doc"> <br />

<span class="iu">Why doesn't Q-Cogo work in Internet Explorer 6 or earlier?</span> <br />

Q-Cogo does not yet support Internet Explorer versions 6 or earlier due to limitations with these browser versions. Early MS browsers did everything differently, making it hard to write the same software for everyone. The decision was made to block Internet Explorer 6 users entirely rather than lead them to a half-functional application. <br /><br />

<span class="iu">Will Q-Cogo ever work in Internet Explorer 6 or earlier?</span> <br />

Maybe. Making web applications work with outdated browsers is a lot of work, and that time might be better spent adding more features for everyone to enjoy. Future versions of Q-Cogo MAY become more backward-compatible. <br /><br />

<span class="iu">What can I do about this?</span> <br />

Download a newer version of <a class="submit" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx" title="Download Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>, or, preferrably, a more reliable browser like <a class="submit" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/upgrade.html" title="Download FireFox">Mozilla Firefox</a>. In addition to being able to use great web applications like Q-Cogo, your computer will be safer and will work more quickly online.<br /><br />
