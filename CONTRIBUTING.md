# How to contribute
All developers who would like to contribute to this awesome Open-Source kindly do so by following the two easy steps below:

<ol>
<li>Fork the Repository</li>
<li>Submit a pull request</li>
</ol>

The project is mainly written in <b>PHP</b>, <b>Javascript</b> and <b>HTML</b> language. 

If you intend to change only the styling and UI of the application kindly do so in a separate branch to avoid confussion. 

Use of a PHP Framework is highly recommended in a separate branch too (CodeIgniter), Laravel is quite complicated and is the last option.
