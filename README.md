Online Surveying Tools which can be used by any one in the profession. 
Our aim is to:
<li>Reduce amount of labor required for basic stuff</li>
<li>Allow firms and individuals to easily organise their work/projects</li>
<li>Provide a calculator that can be carried anywhere and accessed anywhere</li>
<li>Provide a companion for referral anytime while on the job</li>

The live application can be found here:

### The Application is currently still in its development stages.

We are hoping to have completed this project by the year 2021 to cater for all Surveying related needs and achieve the main objective of the online system.
